Guide to Terraforming IoT Reference Architecture in Azure


### Terraform commnds
terraform init - inits the workspacke

terraform plan - checks for errors

terraform apply - deploys

terraform destroy - tears down


### Cloud Shell
Instead of installing the Azure CLI, setting up a Service Principal and the rest of the Terraform Variables you can use the Azure Portal Cloud Shell.

We have made the Terraform experience as simple as possible, as all of the environment details are setup based on your default account through the Azure CLI.
